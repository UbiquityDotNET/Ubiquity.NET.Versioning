  This projects serves as a convenient placeholder to reference the doc files. It uses project relative include

  (Getting docfx to generate files into a folder outside of the build tree (IntermediateOutputPath) but then
  reference content from that is an exercise in frustration - problem unsolved. So this is used instead.)
