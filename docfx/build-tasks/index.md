# About
The Ubiquity.NET.Versioning.Build.Tasks package provides automated support for build versioning
using a Constrained Semantic Version ([CSemVer](https://csemver.org/)).

>[!WARNING]
> As a [Breaking change in .NET SDK 8](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/sdk/8.0/source-link)
> is now setting the build meta data for the `InformationalVersion` property automatically and
> without user consent. (A Highly controversial choice that was more easily handled via an
> OPT-IN pattern) Unfortunately, this was set ON by default and made into an 'OPT-OUT' scenario.
> This library will honor such a setting and does not alter/interfere with it in any way.
> (Though the results can, unfortunately, produce surprising behavior as it is not well
> documented).
>
> If you wish to disable this behavior you can set an MSBUILD property to OPT-OUT as follows:  
> `<IncludeSourceRevisionInInformationalVersion>false</IncludeSourceRevisionInInformationalVersion>`  
>  
> This choice of ignoring the additional data is considered to have the least impact on those
> who are aware of the change and those who use this library to set an explicit build meta data
> string. (Principle of least surprise for what this library can control).
>
> The default behavior added in this breaking change is to use the Repository ID (usually a GIT
> commit hash [FULL SHA form!]) as the build metadata. This is appended with a leading `+` if
> one isn't already in the `InformationalVersion` property. If build metadata is already
> included (Like from use of this task) the id is appended using a `.` instead. So it is ALWAYS
> appended unless the project has opted out of this behavior by setting the property as
> previously described.
>
> Thus, it is ***strongly recommended*** that projects using this package OPT-OUT
> of the new behavior.


## Overview
Officially, SemVer 2.0 doesn't consider or account for publicly available CI builds.
SemVer is only concerned with official releases. This makes CI builds producing 
versioned packages challenging. Fortunately, someone has already defined a solution
to using SemVer in a specially constrained way to ensure compatibility, while also 
allowing for automated CI builds. These new versions are called a [Constrained Semantic
Version](http://csemver.org) (CSemVer and CSemVer-CI).

A CSemVer is unique for each build and always increments while still supporting official
releases. However, in the real world, there are often cases where there are additional builds
that are distinct from official releases and formal CI builds. These include local developer
builds and builds generated from a Pull Request (a.k.a Automated buddy build). Neither SemVer,
nor CSemVer explicitly define any format for these cases. So this library defines a pattern of
versioning that is fully compatible with CSemVer[-CI] and allows for the additional build
types in a way that retains precedence having the least surprising consequences. In particular,
local build versions have a higher precedence than automated or release versions if all other
components of the version match<sup>[1](#footnote_1)</sup>. This ensures that what you are building includes
the dependent components you just built instead of the last one released publicly.

The following is a list of the version formats in descending order of precedence:

| Build Type | Format |
|------------|--------|
| Local build  | `{BuildMajor}.{BuildMinor}.{BuildPatch}.ci.{CiBuildIndex}.ZZZ+{BuildMeta}` |
| Pull Request | `{BuildMajor}.{BuildMinor}.{BuildPatch}.ci.{CiBuildIndex}.PRQ+{BuildMeta}` |
| Official CI builds | `{BuildMajor}.{BuildMinor}.{BuildPatch}.ci-{CiBuildIndex}.BLD+{BuildMeta}` |
| Official PreRelease | `{BuildMajor}.{BuildMinor}.{BuildPatch}-{PreReleaseName}[.PreReleaseNumber][.PreReleaseFix]+{BuildMeta}` |
| Official Release | `{BuildMajor}.{BuildMinor}.{BuildPatch}+{BuildMeta}` |

That is the, CI BuildName (`ZZZ`, `PRQ`, `BLD`) is specifically chosen to ensure the ordering
matches the expected behavior for a build while still making sense for most uses.

This project provides an MSBUILD task to automate the generation of these versions in an easy
to use NuGet Package.

The package creates File and Assembly Versions and defines the appropriate MsBuild properties
so the build will automatically incorporate them.
> **NOTE:**  
> The automatic use of MsBuild properties requires using the new SDK attribute support for .NET
> projects. Where the build auto generates the assembly info. If you are using some other means
> to auto generate the assembly level versioning attributes. You can use the properties
> generated by this package to generate the attributes.

File and AssemblyVersions are computed based on the CSemVer "Ordered version", which
is a 64 bit value that maps to a standard windows FILE VERSION Quad with each part
consuming 16 bits. This ensures a strong relationship between the assembly/file versions
and the packages as well as ensures that CI builds can function properly. Furthermore, this
guarantees that each build has a different file and assembly version so that strong name
signing functions properly to enable loading different versions in the same process.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> A file version quad representation of a CSemVer does NOT carry with it the CI information
> nor any build metadata. It only contains a single bit to indicate a Release vs. a CI build.
> In fact, the official CSemVer specs are silent on the use of this bit though the "playground"
> does indicate an ODD numbered revision is reserved as a CI build.

The Major, Minor and Patch versions are only updated in the primary branch at the time
of a release. This ensures the concept that SemVer versions define released products. The
version numbers used are stored in the repository in the BuildVersion.xml

## Properties used to determine the version
CSemVer.Build uses MSBuild properties to determine the final version number.

|Name               |Default Value                                                 | Description|
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| BuildMajor        | Read from BuildVersion.xml                                   | Major portion of the build number |
| BuildMinor        | Read from BuildVersion.xml                                   | Minor portion of the build number |
| BuildPatch        | Read from BuildVersion.xml                                   | Patch portion of the build number |
| PreReleaseName    | `<Undefined>` or value read from BuildVersion.xml if present | PreRelease Name of the CSemVer |
| PreReleaseNumber  | `<Undefined>` or value read from BuildVersion.xml if present | PreRelease Number of the CSemVer |
| PreReleaseFix     | `<Undefined>` or value read from BuildVersion.xml if present | PreRelease Fix of the CSemVer |
| BuildMeta         | `<undefined>`                                                | Build meta for the version
| CiBuildIndex      | ISO 8601 formated UTC time-stamp for the build               | Provides a unique build to build value guaranteed to increase with each build
| CiBuildName       | `<see notes>`                                                | CSemVer CI name
| GeneratedVersionInfoHeader | `<undefined>` | Full path of the header file to generate [No header generated if not set] [Only applies to a VCXPROJ file ] |
| GenerateAssemblyInfo | `<undefined>` | If set, creates `$(IntermediateOutputPath)AssemblyVersionInfo.g.cs` and includes it for compilation. Generally, only used for legacy CSPROJ files as new SDK projects handle this automatically now |

### CiBuildIndex
Unless specified or a release build [$(IsReleaseBuild) is true] this indicates the CSemVer CI
Build index for a build. For a CI build this will default to the ISO-8601 formatted time stamp
of the build. Consumers can specify any value desired as an override but should ensure the
value is ALWAYS increasing according to the rules of a CSemVer-CI. Generating duplicates for
the same build is an error condition and can lead to consumer confusion. Usually, if set
externally, this is set to the time stamp of the head commit of a repository so that any
automated builds are consistent with the build number. (For PullRequest buddy builds this is
usually left as a build time stamp)

### CiBuildName
Unless explicitly provided, the CiBuildName is determined by a set of properties that indicate
the nature of the build. The properties used (in evaluation order) are:

|Name               |Default Value  |CiBuildName    | Description|
|:-----------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----------|
|IsPullRequestBuild | `<Undefined>` |`PRQ` if true  | Used to indicate if the build is from a pull request |
|IsAutomatedBuild   | `<Undefined>` |`BLD` if true  | Used to indicate if the build is an automated build |
|IsReleaseBuild     | `<Undefined>` |`ZZZ` if !true | Used to indicate if the build is an official release build |

These three values are determined by the automated build in some form. These are either
explicit variables set for the build definition or determined on the fly based on values set by
the build. Commonly a `directory.build.props` for a repository will specify these. The
following is an example for setting them based on an AppVeyor build in the
`Directory.Build.props` file:

```XML
<PropertyGroup>
    <!-- If running in APPVEYOR it is an automated build -->
    <IsAutomatedBuild Condition="'$(IsAutomatedBuild)'=='' AND '$(APPVEYOR)'!=''">true</IsAutomatedBuild>
    <IsAutomatedBuild Condition="'$(IsAutomatedBuild)'==''">false</IsAutomatedBuild>

    <!-- If it has a PR number associated it is a PR build -->
    <IsPullRequestBuild Condition="'$(IsPullRequestBuild)'=='' AND '$(APPVEYOR_PULL_REQUEST_NUMBER)'!=''">true</IsPullRequestBuild>
    <IsPullRequestBuild Condition="'$(IsPullRequestBuild)'==''">false</IsPullRequestBuild>

    <!-- Tags applied without a PR are release builds -->
    <IsReleaseBuild Condition="'$(IsReleaseBuild)'=='' AND '$(APPVEYOR_REPO_TAG)'=='true' AND '$(APPVEYOR_PULL_REQUEST_NUMBER)'==''">true</IsReleaseBuild>
    <IsReleaseBuild Condition="'$(IsReleaseBuild)'==''">false</IsReleaseBuild>
</PropertyGroup>
```

Commonly a build is scripted in a build service such as GitHub Actions or AppVeyor. Such
scripting should set these values based on conditions from the back end system. An example
of this for common systems like GitHub and AppVeyor could look like this:

``` PowerShell
enum BuildKind
{
    LocalBuild
    PullRequestBuild
    CiBuild
    ReleaseBuild
}

function Get-CurrentBuildKind
{
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Determines the kind of build for the current environment

.DESCRIPTION
    This function retrieves environment values set by various automated builds
    to determine the kind of build the environment is for. The return is one of
    the [BuildKind] enumeration values:

    | Name             | Description |
    |------------------|-------------|
    | LocalBuild       | This is a local developer build (e.g. not an automated build)
    | PullRequestBuild | This is a build from a PullRequest with untrusted changes, so build should limit the steps appropriately |
    | CiBuild          | This build is from a Continuous Integration (CI) process, usually after a PR is accepted and merged to the branch |
    | ReleaseBuild     | This is an official release build, the output is ready for publication (Automated builds may use this to automatically publish) |
#>
    [OutputType([BuildKind])]
    param()

    $currentBuildKind = [BuildKind]::LocalBuild

    # IsAutomatedBuild is the top level gate (e.g. if it is false, all the others must be false)
    # This supports identification of APPVEYOR or GitHub explicitly but also supports the common
    # `CI` environment variable. Additional build back-ends that don't set the env var therefore,
    # would need special handling here.
    $isAutomatedBuild = [System.Convert]::ToBoolean($env:CI) `
                        -or [System.Convert]::ToBoolean($env:APPVEYOR) `
                        -or [System.Convert]::ToBoolean($env:GITHUB_ACTIONS)

    if( $isAutomatedBuild )
    {
        # PR and release builds have externally detected indicators that are tested
        # below, so default to a CiBuild (e.g. not a PR, And not a RELEASE)
        $currentBuildKind = [BuildKind]::CiBuild

        # Based on back-end type - determine if this is a release or CI build
        # The assumption here is that a TAG is pushed to the repo for releases
        # and therefore that is what distinguishes a release build. Other conditions
        # would need to use other criteria to determine a PR buddy build, CI build
        # and release build.

        # IsPullRequestBuild indicates an automated buddy build and should not be trusted
        $isPullRequestBuild = $env:GITHUB_BASE_REF -or $env:APPVEYOR_PULL_REQUEST_NUMBER

        if($isPullRequestBuild)
        {
            $currentBuildKind = [BuildKind]::PullRequestBuild
        }
        else
        {
            if([System.Convert]::ToBoolean($env:APPVEYOR))
            {
                $isReleaseBuild = $env:APPVEYOR_REPO_TAG
            }
            elseif([System.Convert]::ToBoolean($env:GITHUB_ACTIONS))
            {
                $isReleaseBuild = $env:GITHUB_REF -like 'refs/tags/*'
            }

            if($isReleaseBuild)
            {
                $currentBuildKind = [BuildKind]::ReleaseBuild
            }
        }
    }

    return $currentBuildKind
}

$currentBuildKind = Get-CurrentBuildKind

# set/reset legacy environment vars for non-script tools
$env:IsAutomatedBuild = $currentBuildKind -ne [BuildKind]::LocalBuild
$env:IsPullRequestBuild = $currentBuildKind -eq [BuildKind]::PullRequestBuild
$env:IsReleaseBuild = $currentBuildKind -eq [BuildKind]::ReleaseBuild
```

## BuildVersion.xml
If the MSBuild property `BuildMajor` is not set, then the base build version is read from the
repository file specified in the BuildVersion.xml, typically this is located at the root of a
repository so that any child projects share the same versioning information. The location of
the file is specified by an MSBuild property `BuildVersionXml`. The contents of the file are
fairly simple and only requires a single `BuildVersionData` element with a set of attributes.
The available attributes are:

|Name              |Description|
|------------------|-----------|
| BuildMajor       | Major portion of the build number |
| BuildMinor       | Minor portion of the build number |
| BuildPatch       | Patch portion of the build number |
| PreReleaseName   | PreRelease Name of the CSemVer |
| PreReleaseNumber | PreRelease Number of the CSemVer |
| PreReleaseFix    | PreRelease Fix of the CSemVer |

Only the Major, minor and Patch numbers are required.
Example:  
```XML
<BuildVersionData
    BuildMajor = "5"
    BuildMinor = "0"
    BuildPatch = "0"
    PreReleaseName = "alpha"
/>
```

## Generated Properties
|Name                |Description|
|--------------------|-----------|
| BuildTime          | Set to the current time (UTC ISO-8601 format) if not already set by build tooling) |
| IsAutomatedBuild   | Automated build system value to indicate this is an automated build |
| IsPullRequestBuild | Automated build system value to indicate this is a build for an untrusted PR |
| IsReleaseBuild     | Automated build system value to indicate this is an official release build (No CI information) |
| CiBuildName        | If not set externally, this is set based on the kind of build |
| CiBuildIndex       | If not set externally, this is set based on the $(BuildTime) property by parsing the ISO-8601 string and computing an index from that |
| BuildMajor         | Major portion of the build; If not set externally, this is set based on the information in the $(BuildVersionXml) file |
| BuildMinor         | Minor portion of the build; If not set externally, this is set based on the information in the $(BuildVersionXml) file |
| BuildPatch         | Patch portion of the build; If not set externally, this is set based on the information in the $(BuildVersionXml) file |
| PreReleaseName     | PreRelease Name for the build [Optional]; If not set externally, this is set based on the information in the $(BuildVersionXml) file, which may not include a value for this |

| PreReleaseFix      | PreRelease Fix for the build [Optional]; If not set externally, this is set based on the information in the $(BuildVersionXml) file, which may not include a value for this |
| FullBuildNumber    | String form of the full CSemVer value for a build |
| ShortBuildNumber   | Short form of the CSemVer for use with legacy NuGet clients (Modern clients support the full name) |

| FileVersionMinor   | Minor portion of the FileVersion number (Used for vcxproj files to generate the version header) |
| FileVersionBuild   | Build portion of the FileVersion number (Used for vcxproj files to generate the version header) |
| FileVersionRevision | Revision portion of the FileVersion number (Used for vcxproj files to generate the version header) |

### BuildTime
Ordinarily this is set for an entire solution by build scripting to ensure that all components using this
build task report the same version number. If it is not set the current time at the moment of property evaluation
for a project is used. This will result in a distinct CI version for each project in a solution. Whether, that
is desired or not is left for the consumer. If it is not desired, then a centralized setting as a build property
or environment variable is warranted.

## Automated build flags
`IsAutomatedBuild`, `IsPullRequestBuild`, and `IsReleaseBuild` are normally set by an automated build script/action
based on the build environment used and aid in determining the CI build name as previously described in
[CiBuildName](#cibuildname).

## CiBuildName
If not explicitly set this is determined by the automated build flags as described in the [CiBuildName](#cibuildname)
section of this document.

----
<sup><a id="footnote_1">1</a></sup> CSemVer-CI uses a latest build format and therefore all
version numbers for a CI build, including local builds use a `Patch+1` pattern as defined by
CSemVer-CI. This ensures that all forms of CI builds have a higher precedence than any release
they are based on. To clarify the understanding of that, a CI build contains everything in a
given release and then some more. How much more, or what release that will eventually become
is intentionally undefined. This allows selection of the final release version based on the
contents of the actual changes. CI builds are understood unstable and subject to complete
changes or even abandoned lines of thought.


<sup><a id="footnote_2">2</a></sup> CSM106 is essentially an internal sanity test. The
props/targets files ensure that `$(CiBuildIndex)` and `$(CiBuildName)` have a value unless
$(IsReleaseBuild) is set. In that case the targets file will force them to empty. So, there's
no way to test for or hit this condition without completely replacing/bypassing the props/targets
files for the task. Which is obviously, an unsupported scenario :grin:.
