// IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:
// ALL AppContext switches in the Ubiquity.NET family of projects use the same naming format for consistency
// <Fully Qualified Namespace>.AppContextSwitches.<SwitchName>
// The FullyQualified Namespace should begin with `Ubiquity.NET` and should be the root namespace of the
// assembly the switch is controlling behavior for.
// In code, they use the same pattern as is used here:
// A static class called AppContextSwitches in the assembly namespace (matching the one in the string form of the name)
// with a const string containing the name of the switch and bool Get/Set properties as convenience accessors.
//
// TODO: Source generator to create this from simpler class that declares properties.
// TODO: Analyzer that detects if class is names "AppContextSwitches" to ensure only one exists in the namespace and
//       follows the correct pattern.
// CONSIDER: Might not be able to use a generator/analyzer in this library as those would likely need to USE the versioning
//           task to apply a version number... May be worth considering how to isolate the task from the versioning lib so
//           that only the task itself has limits on dependencies.
