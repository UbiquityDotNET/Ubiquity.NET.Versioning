    <!--
    // NOTE:
    //  Due to constraints, limitations and general issues with MSBUILD Tasks and dependency resolution
    //  this must NOT have any dependencies beyond MSBUILD itself, and therefore, does it all locally.
    //  This is not as complete as what is offered in the Ubiquity.NET.Versioning library but enables
    //  the tasks to function with the least of changes to the consumer (Update to package name and
    //  version, gets updated/corrected version)
    //
    // For gory details of the problems of creating a task with dependencies
    // See: https://natemcmaster.com/blog/2017/11/11/msbuild-task-with-dependencies/
    //
    // Note that there is a problem with the recommendation Nate makes in that a console tool
    // has additional dependency problems with the runtime identifier and or the framework
    // runtime needed to run it. If it's .NET or something else the supporting runtime and
    // the RID version is needed to execute it. So this just builds a task that is constrained
    // only by the requirements of MSBUILD itself.
