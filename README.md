# Ubiquity.NET.Versioning
This repo includes support for versioning numbers. This support includes:
1) Automated Constrained Semantic Versioning ([CSemVer](https:/csemver.org)) for MSBuild
   projects.
2) A standalone library useful for parsing, sorting and validating versions.
    - [SemVer](https://semver.org)
    - [CSemVer](https://csemver.org)
        - This is a Constrained Semantic Version (That is, a strict subset of a SemVer)
    - [CSemVer-CI](https://csemver.org)
        - This is also a Constrained Semantic Version but is designed for ***POST-RELEASE*** CI
          build numbering. It is NOT a CSemVer but IS a SemVer.

## Overview
Officially, NuGet Packages use a SemVer 2.0 (see http://semver.org).
However, SemVer 2.0 doesn't consider or account for publicly available CI builds.
SemVer is only concerned with official releases. This makes CI builds producing 
versioned packages challenging. Fortunately, someone has already defined a solution
to using SemVer in a specially constrained way to ensure compatibility, while also 
allowing for automated CI builds. These new versions are called a [Constrained Semantic
Version](http://csemver.org) (CSemVer).

## Constrained use of Constrained Semantic Versions
A CSemVer is unique for each CI build and always increments while supporting official releases.
In the real world there are often cases where there are additional builds that are distinct
from official releases and CI builds. Including Local developer builds, builds generated from a
Pull Request (a.k.a Automated buddy build). CSemVer doesn't explicitly define any format for
these cases. So this library defines a pattern of versioning that is fully compatible with
CSemVer and allows for the additional build types in a way that retains precedence having the
least surprising consequences. In particular, local build packages have a higher precedence
than automated builds (CI or release) versions if all other components of the version match.
This ensures that what you are building includes the dependent packages you just built instead
of the last one released publicly.

>[!WARNING]
> The formal 'spec' for [CSemVer](https://csemver.org) remains silent on the point of the short
> format.<sup>[1](#footnote_1)</sup> Instead it relies on only examples. However, the examples are inconsistent on the
> requirement of a delimiter between the short name and number components of a version. It
> shows two examples '1.0.0-b03-01' ***AND*** '5.0.0-r-04-13'. So, which is it? Is the
> delimiter required or not?
>
> This may seem like an entirely academic issue, but when parsing an input it impacts the
> validity of inputs. Also, when the dealing with ordering and the length of otherwise equal
> components comes into play it can impact the behavior as well. How are `1.0.0-b03-01` and
> `1.0.0-b-03-01` ordered in relation to each other? Is the former even a valid CSemVer?
>
> ***This implementation is making no assumptions and simply does NOT support the short form.***
> That may seem like a hard stance but given the ambiguities of the spaec, documenting the behavior
> is difficult. Addditionally, handling all the potential variations makes for extremely complex
> implementation code. All of that for a feature in support of a NuGet client that is now obsolete.
> (NuGet v3 can handle the full name just fine!). Thus, the lack of support in this library.
