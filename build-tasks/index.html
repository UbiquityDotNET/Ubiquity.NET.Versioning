<h1 id="about">About</h1>

<p>The Ubiquity.NET.Versioning.Build.Tasks package provides automated support for build versioning
using a Constrained Semantic Version (<a href="https://csemver.org/">CSemVer</a>).</p>
<div class="WARNING">
<h5>Warning</h5>
<p>As a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/sdk/8.0/source-link">Breaking change in .NET SDK 8</a>
is now setting the build meta data for the <code>InformationalVersion</code> property automatically and
without user consent. (A Highly controversial choice that was more easily handled via an
OPT-IN pattern) Unfortunately, this was set ON by default and made into an 'OPT-OUT' scenario.
This library will honor such a setting and does not alter/interfere with it in any way.
(Though the results can, unfortunately, produce surprising behavior as it is not well
documented).</p>
<p>If you wish to disable this behavior you can set an MSBUILD property to OPT-OUT as follows:<br>
<code>&lt;IncludeSourceRevisionInInformationalVersion&gt;false&lt;/IncludeSourceRevisionInInformationalVersion&gt;</code></p>
<p>This choice of ignoring the additional data is considered to have the least impact on those
who are aware of the change and those who use this library to set an explicit build meta data
string. (Principle of least surprise for what this library can control).</p>
<p>The default behavior added in this breaking change is to use the Repository ID (usually a GIT
commit hash [FULL SHA form!]) as the build metadata. This is appended with a leading <code>+</code> if
one isn't already in the <code>InformationalVersion</code> property. If build metadata is already
included (Like from use of this task) the id is appended using a <code>.</code> instead. So it is ALWAYS
appended unless the project has opted out of this behavior by setting the property as
previously described.</p>
<p>Thus, it is <em><strong>strongly recommended</strong></em> that projects using this package OPT-OUT
of the new behavior.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Officially, SemVer 2.0 doesn't consider or account for publicly available CI builds.
SemVer is only concerned with official releases. This makes CI builds producing
versioned packages challenging. Fortunately, someone has already defined a solution
to using SemVer in a specially constrained way to ensure compatibility, while also
allowing for automated CI builds. These new versions are called a <a href="http://csemver.org">Constrained Semantic
Version</a> (CSemVer and CSemVer-CI).</p>
<p>A CSemVer is unique for each build and always increments while still supporting official
releases. However, in the real world, there are often cases where there are additional builds
that are distinct from official releases and formal CI builds. These include local developer
builds and builds generated from a Pull Request (a.k.a Automated buddy build). Neither SemVer,
nor CSemVer explicitly define any format for these cases. So this library defines a pattern of
versioning that is fully compatible with CSemVer[-CI] and allows for the additional build
types in a way that retains precedence having the least surprising consequences. In particular,
local build versions have a higher precedence than automated or release versions if all other
components of the version match<sup><a href="#footnote_1">1</a></sup>. This ensures that what you are building includes
the dependent components you just built instead of the last one released publicly.</p>
<p>The following is a list of the version formats in descending order of precedence:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Build Type</th>
<th>Format</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Local build</td>
<td><code>{BuildMajor}.{BuildMinor}.{BuildPatch}.ci.{CiBuildIndex}.ZZZ+{BuildMeta}</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pull Request</td>
<td><code>{BuildMajor}.{BuildMinor}.{BuildPatch}.ci.{CiBuildIndex}.PRQ+{BuildMeta}</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Official CI builds</td>
<td><code>{BuildMajor}.{BuildMinor}.{BuildPatch}.ci-{CiBuildIndex}.BLD+{BuildMeta}</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Official PreRelease</td>
<td><code>{BuildMajor}.{BuildMinor}.{BuildPatch}-{PreReleaseName}[.PreReleaseNumber][.PreReleaseFix]+{BuildMeta}</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Official Release</td>
<td><code>{BuildMajor}.{BuildMinor}.{BuildPatch}+{BuildMeta}</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>That is the, CI BuildName (<code>ZZZ</code>, <code>PRQ</code>, <code>BLD</code>) is specifically chosen to ensure the ordering
matches the expected behavior for a build while still making sense for most uses.</p>
<p>This project provides an MSBUILD task to automate the generation of these versions in an easy
to use NuGet Package.</p>
<p>The package creates File and Assembly Versions and defines the appropriate MsBuild properties
so the build will automatically incorporate them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong><br>
The automatic use of MsBuild properties requires using the new SDK attribute support for .NET
projects. Where the build auto generates the assembly info. If you are using some other means
to auto generate the assembly level versioning attributes. You can use the properties
generated by this package to generate the attributes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>File and AssemblyVersions are computed based on the CSemVer &quot;Ordered version&quot;, which
is a 64 bit value that maps to a standard windows FILE VERSION Quad with each part
consuming 16 bits. This ensures a strong relationship between the assembly/file versions
and the packages as well as ensures that CI builds can function properly. Furthermore, this
guarantees that each build has a different file and assembly version so that strong name
signing functions properly to enable loading different versions in the same process.</p>
<div class="IMPORTANT">
<h5>Important</h5>
<p>A file version quad representation of a CSemVer does NOT carry with it the CI information
nor any build metadata. It only contains a single bit to indicate a Release vs. a CI build.
In fact, the official CSemVer specs are silent on the use of this bit though the &quot;playground&quot;
does indicate an ODD numbered revision is reserved as a CI build.</p>
</div>
<p>The Major, Minor and Patch versions are only updated in the primary branch at the time
of a release. This ensures the concept that SemVer versions define released products. The
version numbers used are stored in the repository in the BuildVersion.xml</p>
<h2 id="properties-used-to-determine-the-version">Properties used to determine the version</h2>
<p>CSemVer.Build uses MSBuild properties to determine the final version number.</p>

<h3 id="cibuildindex">CiBuildIndex</h3>
<p>Unless specified or a release build [$(IsReleaseBuild) is true] this indicates the CSemVer CI
Build index for a build. For a CI build this will default to the ISO-8601 formatted time stamp
of the build. Consumers can specify any value desired as an override but should ensure the
value is ALWAYS increasing according to the rules of a CSemVer-CI. Generating duplicates for
the same build is an error condition and can lead to consumer confusion. Usually, if set
externally, this is set to the time stamp of the head commit of a repository so that any
automated builds are consistent with the build number. (For PullRequest buddy builds this is
usually left as a build time stamp)</p>
<h3 id="cibuildname">CiBuildName</h3>
<p>Unless explicitly provided, the CiBuildName is determined by a set of properties that indicate
the nature of the build. The properties used (in evaluation order) are:</p>
<table>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>These three values are determined by the automated build in some form. These are either
explicit variables set for the build definition or determined on the fly based on values set by
the build. Commonly a <code>directory.build.props</code> for a repository will specify these. The
following is an example for setting them based on an AppVeyor build in the
<code>Directory.Build.props</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-XML">&lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
    &lt;!-- If running in APPVEYOR it is an automated build --&gt;
    &lt;IsAutomatedBuild Condition=&quot;'$(IsAutomatedBuild)'=='' AND '$(APPVEYOR)'!=''&quot;&gt;true&lt;/IsAutomatedBuild&gt;
    &lt;IsAutomatedBuild Condition=&quot;'$(IsAutomatedBuild)'==''&quot;&gt;false&lt;/IsAutomatedBuild&gt;

    &lt;!-- If it has a PR number associated it is a PR build --&gt;
    &lt;IsPullRequestBuild Condition=&quot;'$(IsPullRequestBuild)'=='' AND '$(APPVEYOR_PULL_REQUEST_NUMBER)'!=''&quot;&gt;true&lt;/IsPullRequestBuild&gt;
    &lt;IsPullRequestBuild Condition=&quot;'$(IsPullRequestBuild)'==''&quot;&gt;false&lt;/IsPullRequestBuild&gt;

    &lt;!-- Tags applied without a PR are release builds --&gt;
    &lt;IsReleaseBuild Condition=&quot;'$(IsReleaseBuild)'=='' AND '$(APPVEYOR_REPO_TAG)'=='true' AND '$(APPVEYOR_PULL_REQUEST_NUMBER)'==''&quot;&gt;true&lt;/IsReleaseBuild&gt;
    &lt;IsReleaseBuild Condition=&quot;'$(IsReleaseBuild)'==''&quot;&gt;false&lt;/IsReleaseBuild&gt;
&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Commonly a build is scripted in a build service such as GitHub Actions or AppVeyor. Such
scripting should set these values based on conditions from the back end system. An example
of this for common systems like GitHub and AppVeyor could look like this:</p>

    | PullRequestBuild | This is a build from a PullRequest with untrusted changes, so build should limit the steps appropriately |
    | CiBuild          | This build is from a Continuous Integration (CI) process, usually after a PR is accepted and merged to the branch |
    | ReleaseBuild     | This is an official release build, the output is ready for publication (Automated builds may use this to automatically publish) |

<hr>
<p><sup><a id="footnote_1">1</a></sup> CSemVer-CI uses a latest build format and therefore all
version numbers for a CI build, including local builds use a <code>Patch+1</code> pattern as defined by
CSemVer-CI. This ensures that all forms of CI builds have a higher precedence than any release
they are based on. To clarify the understanding of that, a CI build contains everything in a
given release and then some more. How much more, or what release that will eventually become
is intentionally undefined. This allows selection of the final release version based on the
contents of the actual changes. CI builds are understood unstable and subject to complete
changes or even abandoned lines of thought.</p>
<p><sup><a id="footnote_2">2</a></sup> CSM106 is essentially an internal sanity test. The
props/targets files ensure that <code>$(CiBuildIndex)</code> and <code>$(CiBuildName)</code> have a value unless
$(IsReleaseBuild) is set. In that case the targets file will force them to empty. So, there's
no way to test for or hit this condition without completely replacing/bypassing the props/targets
files for the task. Which is obviously, an unsupported scenario 😁.</p>
